<p>Today was a good day. Perhaps even a very good day. A <em>great</em> day? Maybe that&rsquo;s going too far, but it was good enough to make me think about why I left the office feeling that I&rsquo;d accomplished a lot.</p>

<h2 id="a-little-bit-about-my-job">A little bit about my job</h2>

<p>I work in an office with a team of eight people. I should actually clarify that by saying that I <em>lead</em> the team, but I don&rsquo;t like to sound self-important. However, it is useful context for this post. So, I lead a team of people and have three main roles. The first is to review and approve the team&rsquo;s work (I am accountable for its quality and technical accuracy). This normally takes most of my time. It&rsquo;s related to the second role, which is to provide guidance and mentoring for the team. Finally, I have other tasks that are more strategic in nature that I should be doing; these are less involved with the day-to-day activities of the team, and they always fall to the bottom of my to-do list.</p>

<p>My typical day starts with a look at my to-do list and good idea of what I need to do. I select a handful of tasks that I think I should be able to complete during the day. I then try to work on one task at a time, aiming for what seems to be called <a href="https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/deep-work-3cd27b5fd0f9">deep work</a> these days. Sometimes I try to apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique">Pomodoro technique</a>. More often than not, however, this doesn&rsquo;t survive first contact with the enemy. (The enemy being, in this case, external distraction and internal procrastination.) Before I realise, it will lunchtime and I might have achieved one thing before being distracted by an email or phone call.</p>

<h2 id="how-today-was-different">How today was different</h2>

<p>I was in control. Today was quiet in the office &ndash; being a Friday in summer, a few people were on leave, and so I was fairly free from distraction and could focus on what I&rsquo;d planned to do.</p>

<p>I made noticeable progress. Granted, many of the tasks on my list were small or trivial in complexity, but just seeing a to-do list full of completed tasks is satisfying. This was surprising, as I actually wasn&rsquo;t particularly determined to have a productive day. The rest of the week had been tiring and I was resigned to the fact that I was likely to be quite lazy.</p>

<p>I was stimulated. Having spent the majority of the week keeping up with reviewing the work of others, I finally managed to spend some time at a slower pace reading and thinking about some more nuanced topics. This was refreshing and required a different level of work.</p>

<h2 id="is-there-anything-to-learn-from-this">Is there anything to learn from this?</h2>

<p>On previous highly productive days, I&rsquo;ve reasoned that I was productive purely due to the lack of distraction. Today, however, I think that the main difference comes from the fact that I unconsciously removed pressure from myself. There was no excessive expectation, no rigid routine of 25-minute periods of work. Instead, there was a modest, rather than overambitious, list of tasks, and I was also able to spend quality time on a difficult slow-burning problem rather than just having to churn through review.</p>

<p>How can I apply these conditions to every workday? Clearly I can&rsquo;t always just pick the work I want to do, and I can&rsquo;t only work when I feel like it, but perhaps I can adopt elements of those conditions and see some benefit:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use structured tasks and take breaks, but don&rsquo;t be a slave to the structure. Allow your mind to wander within reason, especially if it&rsquo;s work-related</li>
<li>Mix up tasks &ndash; use intellectually stimulating tasks to break up and reward a number of repetitive tasks</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ll be interested to see if I can implement these ideas, and whether it has a noticeable effect. If it doesn&rsquo;t, there&rsquo;s nothing lost, but if it does I might be able to further improve my motivation and overall satisfaction at work.</p>
