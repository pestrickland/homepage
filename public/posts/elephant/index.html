<h2 id="guatemalan-elephant">Guatemalan Elephant</h2>

<p>As my exploration of coffee continued, I tried a bag of Guatemala Elephant coffee from Whittard. The beans that went into the grinder were huge, presumably leading to the elephant in the name.</p>

<p>I made this in a stove-top pot, and when it was brewed I was amazed at the dark, almost thick liquid that poured into my cup. Had I tried this earlier in my introduction to coffee I&rsquo;d probably have grimaced at the potent taste. It definitely had that <em>coffee</em> taste to it, as well as a slight bitterness, but which on reflection was perhaps more fruity. As with the Dominican Republic coffee from my <a href="https://pestrickland.co.uk/posts/coffee/">last post</a> I struggled to identify the chocolate notes that were described by judges from the Great Taste Awards, but that certainly didn&rsquo;t stop me drinking it.</p>

<h2 id="bialetti-moka-express-1-cup">Bialetti Moka Express 1-cup</h2>

<p>When I first bought my coffee equipment, I didn&rsquo;t want to invest too much in case it didn&rsquo;t turn out well. As well as a cheap little cafeti√®re, I also bought a 3-cup stove-top moka pot. This way of making coffee soon became my favourite, and I got into the habit of having a fresh pot brewing as I got ready for work.</p>

<p>Making 3 cups worth of coffee proved to be slightly wasteful; at best I&rsquo;d usually only manage to drink about half of that amount. As luck would have it, I was mindlessly browsing a cookshop the other day when I found a selection of <a href="http://www.bialetti.it/en/index.html" title="Bialetti">Bialetti pots</a>. Without much hesitation I picked up a 1-cup example and went on my way.</p>

<p>Compared to my generic 3-cup pot, the Bialetti has a better build quality and looks better too. Being significantly more expensive even for a smaller size of pot, you are paying a definite premium for the name and logo printed on the side, but I felt it was still good value.</p>

<p>Making coffee with this little pot was just as straightforward as for the bigger version I had previously been using. With less water capacity it was quicker to brew, but that&rsquo;s about all I noticed as it was brewing.</p>

<p>The Bialetti pours very well. My other pot had a tendancy to drip sometimes &ndash; hardly a big problem but just a annoyance.</p>

<p>The main thing I noticed about the 1-cup pot is that it, and the amount of coffee it makes, is <em>tiny</em>. A &ldquo;cup&rdquo; in this case most definitely refers to a 30-ml shot of espresso, and even one of my colourful espresso cups is barely half-filled by a full pot. Despite the diminutive volume of coffee produced, it is still perfect for what I wanted &ndash; a quick shot of hot coffee to keep me going until I get to work.</p>
