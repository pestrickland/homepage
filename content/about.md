I'm Paul Strickland. I'm an engineer and I work in the UK defence industry.

I [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pestrickland), I [run](https://strava.com/athletes/paul_strickland), I read and I sometimes [write](/posts). 

## My job

I've been providing our customers with safety advice for the past ten years. It's a good job and I enjoy it, *most of the time*. I solve problems associated with complex systems, identifying hazards and assessing risk.

I now spend most of my time mentoring new engineers. I’ve enjoyed this much more than I thought I would, and have been intrigued by the different ways I see people learning.

## Outside work

When I’m not working, I like to relax by learning. Whether it's reading, listening to podcasts or playing with technology, I'm always curious.

I've been a runner since late 2016. I absolutely love it, and only wish I'd started sooner.
