I am Paul Strickland. I'm an engineer and I work in the UK defence industry.

I [work](https://www.linkedin.com/in/pestrickland), I [run](https://strava.com/athletes/paul_strickland), I read and I sometimes [write](https://pestrickland.substack.com/) about what interests me.

## My job

I've been providing our customers with safety advice for the past fifteen years. It's a good job and I enjoy doing it. I get to solve problems associated with complex systems; this involves identifying hazards and assessing risk.

I now spend most of my time mentoring new engineers and developing improved ways of working. I’ve enjoyed this much more than I thought I would, and have been intrigued by the different ways I see people learning.

## Outside work

When I’m not working, I like to relax by learning. Whether it's reading, listening to podcasts or playing with technology, I'm always curious. Most recently I've learnt to sew and make my own clothes, knit and spin fibre.

I've been a runner since late 2016. I absolutely love it, and only wish I'd started sooner.
