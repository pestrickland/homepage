We'll soon be moving into a new office at work. Gone will be the leaky, cold and quirky building; instead, we'll be in a new, uniform, open plan environment. Overall I'm still just about looking forward to it, although there is a lot of anxiety about whether we'll all cope.

Since the room available to me will be reducing, I started to think about how to make the most efficient use of my desk. Obviously a big part of the desk is the keyboard, and currently I have a Logitech G610 full-size keyboard at my fingertips (I also have an original Massdrop Ergodox at home). It's a good keyboard, and more importantly it is *vastly* better than the most mushy of laptop keyboards that I have.

With the prospect of reduced space, and enjoying the experience of a mechanical keyboard, the idea of building a new keyboard took hold, especially after finding out about 40% keyboards. So after spending a great deal too much time looking at options, I have procured a Niu Mini keyboard, a bag full of Cherry MX Brown switches (although those clicky blue ones are so nice...) and some keycaps. Now all I need is to decide how to lay out my keys.

## How different an instrument will this be?

I type in Qwerty at work. My Ergodox at home is set up with Colemak. With rare (but comical) exceptions, I can switch between the two without a problem. The split keyboard is so different that I seem to be able to manage the change in hand position and key layout quite well. Where will the 40% ortholinear keyboard fit?

The Ergodox is ortholinear, and my fingers react well to having the keys all aligned in columns. At the same time though, the split nature of the keyboard and the thumb cluster (set up mainly as backspace/delete on the left and space/return on the right) really does make this a different beast to type on. There is a lot more of a "rhythm" to the typing, as if each word is a little riff on an instrument.

On any Qwerty layout my typing method is sloppy -- it's fast, but my hands don't stay in place at all.
