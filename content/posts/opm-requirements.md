## Requirements capture

Our work needs to be traceable. We provide value by being able to trace the history of our advice back across many years.

It makes sense for us to be able to trace the requirements behind our approach. Why did we choose to do something in a particular way?

## OPM learning

### Objects

Objects are things that can be either physical, tangible things, or things that convey information. They could also be thought of as *nouns*. Object examples include "report" and "temperature".

An object can be connected to a process or to another object.

An object can have a variety of different states. A simple example is "hot or cold", but the states don't have to be directly related. For example a passenger flying could have a number of states affected by different processes, such as "checked in", "boarded", "airborne" and "landed".

#### Specification

* An object is depicted by a rectangle
* An object has a title
* An object can be physical or non-physical
  * Physical objects are depicted with a drop shadow
* An object can optionally have a state

### Processes

Processes are things that happen. Specifically, they do things to objects. They are intangible and could be thought of as *verbs*. Processes can be physical, such as "coffee making", but also "battery charging"

Processes are written along the lines of "coffee making".

A process can be connected to an object or to another process.

#### Specification

* A process is depicted by an ellipse
* A process has a title
* A process can be physical or non-physical
  * Physical processes are distinguished from non-physical processes by having a drop shadow

### Transformation

Transformation is what a process does to an object. This can be one of three things:

* Creating a new object
* Consuming an existing object
* Changing the *state* of an existing object

### Consumption and creation

Consumption is depicted by an arrow that points in the direction of the consumer, so the object of water points towards the process that consumes it.

A newly created object is pointed to by the process that creates it. In other words, things are connected by arrows that depict the direction of the supply, consumption and production of the useful things produced by a process.

## Application to our work

### Objects



### Processes

## What is it that we actually do?

* We don't produce things
* We don't build things
* We don't design things
* We don't assemble things

The examples above are common examples used in systems engineering, as so much of the theory seems to be based in the design and manufacture space. But we don't do that. I think before we go any further we need to establish clearly what it is we *do*.


## How to handle a customer request

A customer is expected to write a requirement that is sent to us. We would then act on that requirement.
