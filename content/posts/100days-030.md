When I finish work on a Friday afternoon or evening, my mind often gets excited at the prospect of a weekend full of opportunity. I think about how much progress I'll be able to make on my personal projects and still get time to watch all those films and shows I've been adding to my list. But then by Saturday evening I realise that an entire day has gone past with little to show for it; certainly not the extent of progress I had anticipated.

Why is this? Am I just being lazy, or do I overestimate what I can actually achieve at the same time as underestimating the need for rest?

## Working is work

## Rest is vital

## Give yourself a break
