* Why does systems engineering seem so complex?
* How can we make a better system

In trying to develop my knowledge of systems engineering to a point where I can plan how to improve the way we work, I've been hindered by one thing in particular: *it's so boring*.

This is not a criticism of the subject matter or the authors. It's more a reflection of how difficult I find it to get enthused about a topic that is not immediately interesting to me. It's a topic I can clearly see the value in, but aside from some discussion about tooling that could be implemented, there lacks anything exciting for me to grab hold of and learn about.
