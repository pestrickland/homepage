## Introduction

It's hard to believe that it's been another five weeks since I [first wrote]({{< ref "lockdown-3-weeks" >}}) about adjusting to life spent mainly at home.

## How I am doing

* Weekends are hard
* Weekdays are mostly OK
* There's usually one "bad" day a week
* Shopping is stressful
* Exercise is powerful

### Shopping is stress

* Not enjoyable
* Always seems worse than it is
* Queuing is a curious new normal
* People in aisles...
* Try to limit trips

### Exercise is great

* No longer running every day, but doing something every day
* Injury is a concern
* Much better when there's no one around

### Productivity is poor

* It's just not busy enough to thrive
* When there's work to do, I'm brilliant

## Summary

* It's sustainable.
