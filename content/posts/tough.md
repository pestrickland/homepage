In contrast to an [earlier post]({{<ref "good-day.md">}}), I've been having a tough time recently. Some of it was expected -- at this stage in our delivery cycle there is always more pressure -- but that knowledge doesn't soften the impact. Right now, I'm suffering more than normal, but I hope that trying to write about it might help a bit.

## How much do you care?

Are you one of those people who can happily walk out of the office at 5pm and think nothing about work until the next morning, regardless of how much is going on? I'm not.

Recently, I squeezed about six days' worth of work into three days. With a deadline looming and only a limited amount of my own time available, I tried to do as much as I could to support my team. You see, my work comes at the end, where I review and approve the work of everyone else. In effect, I decided that I would let the team have each day to complete some work, and I'd spend the evening reviewing it and sending it back to them for the next morning.

In my more arrogant moments, I think my approach to work is quite noble. In a way, it doesn't matter *how* the work gets done, as long as it *is* done. But whilst this has worked in the past, my experience this week leaves me questioning everything.

## Taking on too much

We often take on too much work. Sometimes we think we can manage more than we actually can. Other times, we know that we'll struggle but for various reasons we try anyway. Sometimes we go so far as to tell other people that we can't manage, only to *still* take on the work. We might be persuaded, appealed to, bullied... it doesn't matter; the result is the same: we take on more than we can manage.

Why do we do this? Why commit this act of self harm?

## Consequences




* Can you rely on people?
* *Should* you rely on people?
* How much do you care?
* You can't do it all on your own
* You need to trust
* Trust can only go so far

## Angry

I spent over 40 hours working a three-day week recently. I did it because I was trying to get finished before a deadline, and I needed to give other people time to get their work to me. I did it because I cared about achieving what we set out to achieve.

Two weeks later, and I don't much care for trying to achieve things. I've come to believe that it doesn't matter how much *I* try -- something else will inevitably ruin any chances we have to succeed.
