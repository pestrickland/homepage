title: Getting Tailwind CSS and Svelte working together

Following my last post I had to do some further work to get a Svelte and Tailwind CSS development environment up and running. I used [this post (and its comments)][dev.to post].

[dev.to post]: https://dev.to/inalbant/a-simpler-way-to-add-tailwindcss-to-your-svelte-project-11ja

To process the CSS when running the dev server, an additional npm package was required. I also forgot to install the prettier code formatter so I grabbed that too:

```sh
npm i npm-run-all prettier prettier-plugin-svelte --save-dev
```

The following scripts then needed to be added to `package.json` to enable reloading to occur properly when running `npm run dev`:

```json
"scripts": {
  "autobuild": "rollup -c -w",
  "watch:tailwind": "postcss public/tailwind.css -o public/index.css -w",
  "dev": "run-p autobuild watch:tailwind"
}
```

This is just another reminder for myself to eventually gather all the steps in one place. Check out the post above for more guidance about the setup.
