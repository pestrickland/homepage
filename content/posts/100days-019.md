Every year towards the end of September the mornings here start to get noticeably darker. Rather than being able to jump out of bed and see the light of a new day through the windows, I find myself wondering if it is actually time to get up or not. It surprises me every year, and this grim sense of getting up at night makes a real chore out of starting the day. We have a few weeks left until the clocks go back and provide us with a bit of respite, but in reality we are facing 6 months of dark mornings again.

Over the last fortnight this darkness has made running difficult. It's all in my mind -- I realise that -- but I find myself having to work quite hard to convince myself to go outside. I can find excuses ("it's too dark to run safely on the road") but then mitigate them ("try this other route"); I suggest that I'm too tired and need a rest but know that isn't true; I volunteer the compromise of running later in the day, but hate having to dodge people at a safe distance.

Eventually, I find myself with my shorts and shoes on. I open the door, greet the weather and before I know it I am warmed up, breathing the fresh morning air and running strongly into the sunrise.
