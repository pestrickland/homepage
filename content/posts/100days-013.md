Part of my job involves developing the skills of others. Well, I don't know if that's how it was advertised, but it's certainly what I do. As with many aspects of my role, nobody told me to do it. I didn't attend a training course to learn how to do it. I haven't got a certificate to show that I can do it. Not so many years ago I would have been indignant at the apparent assumption that I would just pick up this additional burden and do it without support or reward. And yet now I do it and barely notice. What has changed?

## What motivates you to work?

Ask anyone this question in a work setting and there's a good chance that their first answer will include something like one of the following:

* Money
* Position
* Title

There is no point denying the importance of some of these factors, and plenty of people are unfortunately poorly rewarded in these areas. But if you are fortunate enough to have enough money to get by, and have the luxury to think a bit more deeply about this question, I think you will get to a point where you start to value these attributes:

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose

These *intrinsic motivators* have stayed in my mind ever since I read *Drive* by Daniel Pink [^1] (watch [this short primer](https://youtu.be/u6XAPnuFjJc) from the RSA if you haven't already). The idea is that work that requires you to think is less motivated by external factors such as money, but motivated by a sense of autonomy in how the work is conducted, the idea that the work develops a mastery of the subject matter, and that the work has meaning or purpose.

[^1]: Pink, D. *Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us*, Canongate Books, 2010.

I have worked in the same field for nearly thirteen years. I have been fortunate to have almost always had a sense of purpose about the work I do. As for autonomy and mastery, there wasn't any obvious progress and they were areas I was most likely to complain about. Now, however, my perspective is changing. Autonomy might actually have been forced upon us by the sudden move to working from home, and is the subject for another post. But I think I might be willing to accept that I do feel a certain sense of mastery.

## Mastery

* It takes a very long time
* Is it for everyone?
* can you be a generalist master?
