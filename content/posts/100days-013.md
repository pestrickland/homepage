Part of my job involves developing the skills of others. Well, I don't know if that's how it was advertised, but it's certainly what I do. As with many aspects of my role, nobody told me to do it. I didn't attend a training course to learn how to do it. I haven't got a certificate to show that I can do it. Not so many years ago I would have been indignant at the apparent assumption that I would just pick up this additional burden and do it without support or reward. And yet now I do it and barely notice. What has changed?

## What motivates you?

* Money?
* Position?
* Title?

* Autonomy
* Mastery
* Purpose

## Mastery

* It takes a very long time
* Is it for everyone?
* can you be a generalist master?
