Today was a good day. Perhaps even a very good day. A *great* day? Maybe that's going too far, but it was good enough to make me think about why I left the office feeling that I'd accomplished a lot. 

## A little bit about my job

I work in an office with a growing team of eight people. I should actually clarify that by saying that I *lead* the team, but I don't like to sound self-important. However, it's useful context for this post; so I lead a team of people and have three main roles. The first is to review and approve the team's work (I am accountable for the output's quality and technical correctness). This takes up a great deal of my time. It's related to the second role, which is to provide guidance and mentoring for the team. Finally, I have other tasks that are more strategic in nature that I should be doing; these are less involved with the day-to-day activities of the team, and they always fall to the bottom of my to-do list.

My typical day starts with my to-do list, and I select a handful of tasks that I think I should be able to complete in the day. I then try to work on one task at a time, aiming for what seems to be called [deep work](https://medium.com/designing-atlassian/deep-work-3cd27b5fd0f9) these days. Sometimes I also try to follow the [Pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique). More often than not, however, this doesn't survive first contact with the enemy.

## How today was different

Today was quiet in the office. Being a Friday in summer, a few people were on leave, and so I was almost entirely free from distraction. 

I got a lot done. Granted, many of the tasks on my list were small or trivial in complexity, but seeing a list of completed to-dos is very satisfying. I actually wasn't particularly determined to have a productive day today. The rest of the week had been quite tiring and I was resigned to the fact that it was likely to be quite a lazy day. 

Having spent the majority of the week keeping up with reviewing the work of others, I finally managed to spend some time at a slower pace reading and thinking about some more nuanced topics. This was quite refreshing.

## Is there anything to learn from this?

On previous highly productive days, I've explained the reason to myself as being purely due to the lack of distraction. Today, however, I think that the main difference comes from the fact that I unconsciously removed pressure from myself. There was no rigid routine of 25-minute periods of work. Instead, there was a modest, rather than ambitious, list of tasks, and I was also able to spend quality time on a slow-burning task rather than just having to churn through review.

How can I apply these conditions to every workday? Clearly I can't always just pick the work I want to do, and I can't only work when I feel like it, but perhaps I can adopt elements of those conditions and see some benefit:

* Use structured tasks and take breaks, but don't be a slave driver about it. Allow your mind to wander within reason, especially if it's work-related
* Mix up tasks -- use intellectually stimulating tasks to break up a number of repetitive tasks

I'll be interested to see if I can implement these ideas, and whether it has a noticeable effect.
