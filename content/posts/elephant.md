## Guatemalan Elephant

As my exploration of coffee continued, I tried a bag of Guatemala Elephant coffee from Whittard. The beans that went into the grinder were huge, presumably leading to the elephant in the name.

I made this in a stove-top pot, and when it was brewed I was amazed at the dark, almost thick liquid that poured into my cup. Had I tried this earlier in my introduction to coffee I'd probably have grimaced at the potent taste. It definitely had that *coffee* taste to it, as well as a slight bitterness, but which on reflection was perhaps more fruity. As with the Dominican Republic coffee from my [last post]({{<ref "coffee.md">}}) I struggled to identify the chocolate notes that were described by judges from the Great Taste Awards, but that certainly didn't stop me drinking it.

## Bialetti Moka Express 1-cup

When I first bought my coffee equipment, I didn't want to invest too much in case it didn't turn out well. As well as a cheap little cafeti√®re, I also bought a 3-cup stove-top moka pot. This way of making coffee soon became my favourite, and I got into the habit of having a fresh pot brewing as I got ready for work.

Making 3 cups worth of coffee proved to be slightly wasteful; at best I'd usually only manage to drink about half of that amount. As luck would have it, I was mindlessly browsing a cookshop the other day when I found a selection of [Bialetti pots](http://www.bialetti.it/en/index.html "Bialetti"). Without much hesitation I picked up a 1-cup example and went on my way.

Compared to my generic 3-cup pot, the Bialetti has a better build quality and looks better too. Being significantly more expensive even for a smaller size of pot, you are paying a definite premium for the name and logo printed on the side, but I felt it was still good value.

Making coffee with this little pot was just as straightforward as for the bigger version I had previously been using. With less water capacity it was quicker to brew, but that's about all I noticed as it was brewing.

The Bialetti pours very well. My other pot had a tendancy to drip sometimes -- hardly a big problem but just a annoyance.

The main thing I noticed about the 1-cup pot is that it, and the amount of coffee it makes, is *tiny*. A "cup" in this case most definitely refers to a 30-ml shot of espresso, and even one of my colourful espresso cups is barely half-filled by a full pot. Despite the diminutive volume of coffee produced, it is still perfect for what I wanted -- a quick shot of hot coffee to keep me going until I get to work.
