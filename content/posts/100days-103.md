- Why does systems engineering seem so complex?
- How can we make a better system

In trying to develop my knowledge of systems engineering to a point where I can plan how to improve the way we work, I've been hindered by one thing in particular: _it's so boring_.

This is not a criticism of the subject matter or the authors. It's more a reflection of how difficult I find it to get enthused about a topic that is not immediately interesting to me. It's a topic that I can clearly see the value in, but aside from some discussion about tooling that could be implemented, there lacks anything exciting for me to grab hold of and learn about.

One aspect that comes to mind is in the management of requirements. These are crucial to get right in our line of work, and some of the most difficult things too. However, the literature I have been reading is virtually impenetrable in such a way that makes me think that it's completely understandable why requirements aren't managed in a better way.

To take a different example, look at how Basecamp's Shape Up book discusses the pros and cons of planning.
