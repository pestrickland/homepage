The twelfth week of lockdown started badly for me. It seemed to mark a turning point for many people, with lofty ideas of going back to normal. This was not my experience, nor did it seem like a good idea. Now, after three months, my thoughts need to turn to constructing a *new* normal. 

## Making do

At the beginning, amongst all the uncertainty that the pandemic brought with it, I [said before]({{<ref "lockdown-3-weeks">}}) how I thought I might be affected. I was pleasantly surprised at my adaptation to working remotely and being fairly productive. Several weeks later, that does still seem to be the case. My routine is established, I get work done, and I have more opportunity to exercise than I often need. 

Reflecting on those past weeks, however, I think I might have been trying to convince myself that I was OK. I am certainly set up for remote working, and in a much better way than many people will be. But while this is fine in terms of infrastructure, my mental model is beginning to fail. I can catch myself thinking that this is only temporary, that a return to normality is coming. Even when I externally express views that I am content with this, and that I have no confidence in the early easing of the restrictions that has been occurring, unconsciously I still expect this to be over at a point in the near future. Therefore I am willing to continue the work ethic of starting early and not stopping until I have completed the correct number of hours. Despite the fact that I am then so wiped out by the afternoon that I can do very little, the very idea of having so many hours of free time perpetuates this behaviour.

There are now signs of burnout that I'm willing to accept. At the same time, there are no signs that the previous way of working is due to return any time soon. Therefore, I must adapt. 

## Making the future

* How to work in isolation for the long term
* Embrace the re-opening of things when it is safe, not just because it is legal
* Take breaks
* Take exercise
* Focus vs relaxing -- clearly switch between the two
* Communication must improve
