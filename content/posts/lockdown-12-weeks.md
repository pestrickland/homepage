The twelfth week of lockdown started badly for me. It seemed to mark a turning point for many people, with lofty ideas of going back to normal. This was not my experience, nor did it seem like a good idea. Now, after three months, my thoughts need to turn to constructing a *new* normal. 

## Making do

* Everything so far has been temporary
* Even when I thought I was well set up, this was just in terms of infrastructure
* My mental model has been built around temporarily sustaining this change
* It's not certain to be sustainable

## Making the future

* How to work in isolation for the long term
* Embrace the re-opening of things when it is safe, not just because it is legal
* Take breaks
* Take exercise
* Focus vs relaxing -- clearly switch between the two
* Communication must improve
