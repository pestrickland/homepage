The twelfth week of lockdown started badly for me. It seemed to mark a turning point for many people, with lofty ideas of going back to normal. This was not my experience, nor did it seem like a good idea. Now, after three months, my thoughts need to turn to constructing a *new normal*. 

## Making do

At the beginning, amongst all the uncertainty that the pandemic brought with it, I [said before]({{<ref "lockdown-3-weeks">}}) how I thought I might be affected. I was pleasantly surprised at my adaptation to working remotely and being fairly productive. Several weeks later, that does still seem to be the case. My routine is established, I get work done, and I have more opportunity to exercise than I often need. 

Reflecting on those past weeks, however, I think I might have been trying to convince myself that I was OK when perhaps I was not. I am certainly set up for remote working, and in a much better way than many people will be. But while this is fine in terms of infrastructure, my mental model is beginning to fail. I can catch myself thinking that this is only temporary, that a return to normality is coming. Even when I externally express views that I am content with this, and that I have no confidence in the early easing of the restrictions that has been occurring, unconsciously I still expect this to be over at a point in the near future. Therefore I am willing to continue the work ethic of starting early and not stopping until I have completed the correct number of hours. Despite the fact that I am then so wiped out by the afternoon that I can do very little, the very idea of having so many hours of free time perpetuates this behaviour.

There are now signs of burnout that I'm willing to accept. At the same time, there are no signs that the previous way of working is due to return any time soon. Therefore, I must adapt. 

## Being fearful

It seems now that every day there is news about the relaxing of lockdown restrictions, shops opening again and people being happy to head out and act more normally. This should be good news -- of course it should. But I can't stand to hear it. Why is this? I can think of two reasons:

* I think it's too soon, that recent decisions have been taken for political reasons, to distract from poor behaviour at the government level rather than because of "the science" that is so often touted
* I am fearful of false hope; I know what my routine is, what the rules are, and am content to live in that way. The idea of more uncertainty as things change seems to cause an anxiety in me: what if I don't know the latest guidance? What if someone else acts in the wrong way, or thinks I am acting in the wrong way?

## Making the future

Regardless of the concerns above, my employer has been fantastic. It is clear that the approach the company is taking is one that puts our health and safety first. All of us who are able to work from home are required to, and some form of that looks set to continue. With that in mind then, I need to turn my mind to improving my living and working environment to make it more sustainable.

### How to work

### Embrace the new freedoms on your own terms

### Communication must improve

### Ditch the idea of work-life balance

* How to work in isolation for the long term
* Embrace the re-opening of things when it is safe, not just because it is legal
* Take breaks
* Take exercise
* Focus vs relaxing -- clearly switch between the two
* Communication must improve
