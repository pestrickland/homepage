I've spent a lot of time recently thinking about engineering practice and the various tools and techniques that are emerging. One of the most interesting that I was recently introduced to is Model-based Systems Engineering (MBSE), in particular its application to the concepts of Digital Threads/Digital Twins seen in some manufacturing fields.

I'm a bit prone to getting very excited about the prospect of using new tools in my work; part of this is just my fascination with the new but another part comes from frustration at the highly regulated, slow and old fashioned nature of my industry. The idea of being able to work in a smarter, more efficient way is always tantalising.

The problem to be solved:

* Late delivery of evidence is the norm
* Unmoveable delivery dates
* Fast-changing requirements or priorities

The challenge:

* Reverse engineer our existing system
* Apply systems thinking to a type of work that sits separate from *normal* engineering design
* Requirements capture needs to capture the requirements of our customer, not the requirements for the system under test
