Title: Handling Event-based Risks
Status: draft

One of the problems of assessing the third party risk associated with aircraft
store releases is how to manage per event risk. Releasing a bomb, jettisoning a
fuel tank or firing missiles are all discrete events. Many of the potential
failures that could be hazardous to third parties can only occur during that
release event. Managing such risk, however, is complicated by the fact that
many risk management plans use a time base of per hour, the life of a fleet,
or on annual risk to life. Converting per event risk to one of these systems
raises a number of problems.

##The normal way of assessing risk
The assessment of risk associated with flying military aircraft is based -- to a
large degree -- on system reliability. The aircraft itself is a complex system, and
each piece of equipment in that system has a failure rate. In order to judge
the suitability of that equipment for use in an aircraft, it makes sense to measure
the failure rate of that component over the life of the aircraft. If an aircraft has an
anticipated life of 10000 hours and a piece of equipment has a failure rate of 1
in every 1000 hours, then the operator of that aircraft knows that on average,
each aircraft will require that equipment to be replaced ten times in its life.

##Why per-event risk is appropriate for weapon release events
For the vast majority of its life, a typical guided weapon is stored in a box. At
regular intervals it may be connected to a test set and have varying levels of
built-in test conducted.

A small part of its life may consist of being loaded onto an aircraft and
flown. During this phase, it will again undergo testing by the
aircraft. It will also experience environmental effects: vibration from air
carriage, hot and cold temperature soaking from being sat in the sun waiting
for the aircraft to take off and from spending time at altitudes of thousands
of feet in the cold atmosphere, acoustic vibration, rain, etc. It will also
undergo kinetic heating from being flown at high speeds whilst exposed to the
airflow.

The above features of a weapon's life can all contribute to failures of some
sort. Vibration, thermal stress and shock can affect the structural integrity
of the weapon. However, it is once the weapon is fired that it undergoes the
most strenuous part of its life.

During a weapon release event, a large chain of events is put into motion. When
successful, the weapon will separate safely from the aircraft, arm itself,
guide itself towards the target and hit the target within the specified levels
of accuracy for the weapon. Being the most complex part of the weapon's life,
there is a lot that could potentially go wrong.

##Converting between per event and per flying hour
Flying aircraft with weapons combines two approaches to calculating risk. The
aircraft flies around for hours, during which time equipment failures could
happen at any point; the weapon, although undergoing stress from being carried,
experiences its most complex phase of operation only when it is released. So
how do you incorporate the probabilities associated with weapon failure into
the per flying hour risk management system that the aircraft uses to determine
what is acceptable or not?

One way is simply to make assumptions about weapon carriage and firing rates.
As an example, assume that a weapon is only carried for one hour out of every
hundred flown. Of those hours carried, a weapon is only fired once every hundred
hours. Therefore, a weapon is only fired once every 10,000 aircraft flying hours.
Now assume that there is a particular failure that can occur when the weapon is
fired; this failure causes the weapon to collide with the aircraft and
detonate, resulting in loss of the aircraft and crew. Finally, assume that this
failure occurs in 10% of all firings.

From a per firing perspective, a chance that 1 in 10 of weapon firings result
in loss of aircraft and crew is obviously unacceptable. However, using the
aircraft risk management system paints a different picture. Since weapons are
only fired once every 10,000 hours, the probability of the accident is 1 in
100,000 hours, which might be viewed as acceptable for the example aircraft.

A further complication comes with the validity of the assumptions made. In a
peacetime situation, assumptions such as those listed above may be entirely
valid. Once a drawn out conflict happens -- such as the operation in
Afghanistan -- those assumptions can
quickly become invalid, and may change on a regular basis. Expecting the risk
to be recalculated regularly is not really an option -- there are a lot more
useful activities that people need to be doing. But it is all too easy for
high-risk activity to be masked by outdated assumptions.
