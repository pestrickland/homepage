Surely, anybody who claims to be surprised at the government's latest behaviour of obscuring the truth is themself a liar. The stinking torrent of untruth has been flowing for so long now that it is just a question of what the hapless minister will be reported to be "defending" on the next day's news. The only thing that genuinely surprises me is how bad these people are at attempting to cover up the truth. You don't start by lightly massaging the truth and _then_ flatly denying what you did -- that's the wrong way round!
