I've nearly finished collecting all the components I need for my next keyboard -- a 40% ortholinear Niu Mini. Looking at the options available with QMK firmware I'm very excited at what I might be able to do. The main decision for now, however, is whether I find it easier to use QWERTY, as on my full-size work keyboard, or Colemak that I have on my original Ergodox at home. I want to try Colemak but I'll see how easily my hands adapt to the new hardware.
