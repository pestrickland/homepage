Although we aren't yet mandated to stay isolated it is encouraged. Therefore, I tried to spend the weekend at home, not going out except for one run this morning. It was tough, demotivating and quite scary, but I managed it. If the situation gets worse, I must try not to dread the idea of staying indoors.
