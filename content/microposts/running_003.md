Consistent stress is the aim of my running at the moment. After two weeks each of one speed workout, one long run, two strength/stability sessions and four easy runs, this week I'm looking at volume. I'll keep the strength and stability but drop the speed work. Each easy run aims to be about an hour in duration but no more than a steady pace. The long run will stay the same, and I'll review this after two weeks if all goes to plan.
