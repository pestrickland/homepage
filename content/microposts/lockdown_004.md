Today was not good. No early-morning enthusiasm before the afternoon slump, just the slump. The weather was gorgeous, and I cleaned my windows for the second time this week (though they did need it; they were filthy). But gorgeous weather that you can only look at offers little solace. Still, I got outside for a run this evening and that was nice.
