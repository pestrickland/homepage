One surprising source of solace in these times is the daily engagement I have with one of my favourite YouTube creators -- [TheGingerRunner](https://www.youtube.com/user/TheGingerRunner). As a Patreon supporter, I get the opportunity to watch a live show every weekday evening. It's trivial, but I guess it just adds a sense of community to my life.
