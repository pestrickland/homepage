Can a government lose moral authority purely through incompetence, or does it require malice? My own government certainly appears to have no authority. But if it was *just* the repeated bungling of a crisis and mistakes that cost thousands of lives, could they assert some weight behind their latest proclamations? Is the irreparable damage only caused by the lies, corruption and blatant disregard for the rules that they imposed on others, or would it have happened anyway?
