Do you ever *really* relax? Reading [this article](https://zenhabits.net/resting/) at zen habits made me realise how little I do. I follow a 10-minute meditation course every day during which I definitely relax. And I think when I go for a walk I come close to it, except I'm almost always listening to podcasts (if only passively). The rest of the time I am always doing something or fretting about doing something. I should take more time to do nothing.
