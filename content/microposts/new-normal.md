As we enter the second winter of the "new normal" and still working primarily from home and with a great amount of flexibility, I am starting to think that my energy levels are becoming more aligned to the amount of daylight. By 3pm I feel like I should be finishing for the day, and I feel exhausted by 4pm, ready for a relaxing evening. I guess it doesn't matter as long as I work well when I feel energised?
