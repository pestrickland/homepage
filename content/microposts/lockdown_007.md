An eventful day today. I spent two hours standing in an outside queue at the pharmacy, ten minutes queueing to go into the supermarket and, for the first time this year, did my evening run in the daylight. Sometimes I catch myself thinking about this being the *new normal*. I worry that I might forget what life was like *before*.
