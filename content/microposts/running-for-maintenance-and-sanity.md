I feel much less fit than I did earlier in the year. I'm still running about five days a week, but the distances are a bit shorter, the effort lower. Some of it has been beyond my control and I've missed the odd day or two in recent weeks. The weather doesn't help either. So while I am still running, it's very much for my sanity and to attempt to maintain _some_ fitness rather than anything approaching training.
