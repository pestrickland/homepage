January 2021 has been hard work so far. It is winter, there is a pandemic and the country is yet again in a nationwide lockdown. But it's been such an exhausting month so far. I'm physically tired as well as feeling mentally drained.

Although it's been hard, it's not all bad. There have been some changes that show promise, both at work and at home, but they all add to this fatigue that I seem to have gained.
