I can summarise the week thus: a cautious start that slowly became more more manageable as I settled in for the long term; after a few days I was quite enjoying my new routine. Suddenly this afternoon, some utterly appalling behaviour knocked me down off that wave of hope. It was ordinary work behaviour rather than anything related to the lockdown, but reminded me of my fragility. The challenge now is to recover and not let that person ruin my weekend.
