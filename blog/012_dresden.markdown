Summary: After reading Dresden&#58; Tuesday 13 February 1945 by Frederick Taylor, I was fascinated by the controversy surrounding the air raid on that city. The book is extremely well written, and I try to put the bombing into context. It is difficult to imagine that sort of bombing being acceptable today, but today we have technology that allows us to attack targets with great accuracy. The recent conflict between Israel and Palestine has made me think how this accuracy can be used well; it also raises questions in my mind about the consequences when things go wrong. We must always strive to improve, even when we think we have the best technology available.

Whilst I was still recovering at my parents house, I picked a copy of
Frederick Taylor's *Dresden: Tuesday 13 February 1945* off the shelf. I
didn't know a great deal about the bombing of that city, except that it caused
a firestorm. Coming from a world of precision-guided weaponry and wars fought
in the spotlight of the media, however, I found it difficult to comprehend how
the area bombing of a city could ever be justified.

Reading the book, I was fascinated by how much controversy surrounded the
bombing of this particular city. For some reason, it seems to have been treated
entirely differently to bombings of other cities such as Hamburg, where similar
levels of devastation were wreaked. There has also been much speculation of the
true number of casualties over past decades.

Taylor's work appears to be objective to a large degree and extremely thorough.
It attempts to dispell myths that Dresden was an "innocent" city in the war,
that its bombing was unnecessary due to the state of the war, and that hundreds
of thousands of people were killed. In doing so, I think he makes a strong
case that the city was treated as a legitimate target (like so many other cities), that an
element of chance led to ideal weather conditions for the attack to start a
firestorm, and that a more realistic figure of between 25,000 and 40,000 people
were killed.

We live in a world now where targets can be attacked with a high degree of
accuracy and precision. For example, in [this footage](http://gu.com/p/2b45m
"Brimstone attack in Afghanistan") a Brimstone missile successfully attacks a
building, leaving the surrounding area unscathed. The idea now, of bombing an
entire area of a city is almost absurd. "Area bombing", as it was known came
about for several reasons, but one of those was that it was simply not possible
to accurately attack a factory or piece of infrastructure. Early in the war
only a third of aircraft reported as hitting the target were within *three miles*
of that target. In modern warfare, figures are closer to three metres.
Technology did improve immensely during the war, but even by its end it was a long
way from allowing attacks to be made with the accuracy we expect today.

At that
time though, high-tech warfare was what happened at Dresden: airborne radar was used to
aid navigation to the target, pathfinder aircraft lay down target markers to
illuminate the aiming point, and a "master bomber" loitered over the target
providing instructions to the main force. To ensure the main force arrived with
sufficient strength in numbers, numerous diversionary raid were launched on the
same night, radio and radar countermeasures were used to baffle the enemy air
defences and the flight path of the force suggested numerous possible targets
right up to the last few minutes. The bomb loads themselves were a carefully
selected mix of high explosive and incendiary in order to cause the right sort
of damage. This was the state of the art for the mid-1940s. Had supremely
accurate bombs and equipment been available, then they would no doubt have been
put to effective use.

Another consideration I think is important is that a state of "total war"
existed. War wasn't just restricted to a remote country that would appear on
the news every so often -- it encompassed everything that the nation did. With
hundreds of soldiers and civilians dying every day, perhaps the idea of bombing
an area known to be inhabited by civilians was less unpalatable than it is
today, especially if bombing that area might have resulted in reducing production of
armament, and may even have shortened the war by several weeks.

It is difficult to think of the bombing of cities such as Dresden without the
knowledge of what is possible in today's conflicts. Although "only" 40,000
people may have been killed rather than the hundreds of thousands quoted
elsewhere, it is still a huge number of lives. However, the situation was very
different in those dark days, and I can understand that the decision-makers did
what they believed was necessary to pursue a victory in the war, and finally peace.

I saw a
[photograph](http://www.boston.com/bigpicture/2012/11/israel_-_gaza_conflict.html#photo23 "Bomb crater in Gaza") taken during the recent conflict between Israel
and Palestine that caught my interest. It shows the crater following an Israeli
air strike on a suspected rocket-launching site. Now, an entire building has
been destroyed, in contrast to the Brimstone attack in the video linked above,
where something more akin to a room was destroyed. However, the surrounding
buildings, whilst damaged, are still standing, and appear to remain inhabited.
Compared to the bombing campaign during the Second World War, this is far
superior in terms of accuracy and unnecessary damage.

What interests me in particular about the image is that the building destroyed
could well have been one identical to those surrounding it. If this attack was
successful in destroying the intended target, it is an example of guided
weapons being used to good effect. If civilians were killed or wounded in or
around the destroyed builing, it would be termed *collateral damage*. An
acceptable amount of such damage might have been determined by the importance
of the target, and the attack authorised based on those considerations.

What if the weapon had missed the target? Or if the building attacked -- one of
several buildings identical in appearance, especially from several thousand
feet in the air -- turned out to be the wrong one? Now there is a case of
civilian casualties, but no successful attack to offset that unfortunate
by-product of war.

Thinking about these "what-if" questions is something that interests me a great
deal. In my mind they all lead to asking whether it is possible to quantify the
risk to a particular population, and it was one of the main reasons for starting to write a third party risk model simulation tool. Sometimes I wonder whether those
questions are irrelevant and that the work I have been doing is nugatory. After
all, the weapons employed today might be 95% reliable, so why worry about the
5% chance of one failing and missing the target? Indeed, the risk of that
happening is small and ever-decreasing. But the new aspect I have in my
thinking is that Dresden was attacked using tactics and technology that were,
at the time, the state of the art. One of the reasons that the attack was so
devastating was that it occurred at the peak of the development of area
bombing. Trying to improve on it may well have seemed futile to some.

If what was state of the art 60 years ago now seems, to many, to be abhorrent,
might the same be said in half a century of the state of the art today?
