Summary: I decided to build a Planet X Kaffenback to use for commuting. As I was building the bike, I took pictures and wrote about the experience.
sidebarimage: -images-finished_kaffenback.jpg

This year I have been trying to cycle to work three times a week. The ride is
quite pleasant; I can avoid most of the traffic and the route is quite scenic.
However, to get to work I have to cycle about 14 km and climb about 145 m. Not
a great deal to complain about I know, but it is a tough ride for me. So far I
have been using my
[On-One 456](http://www.on-one.co.uk/i/q/FROO456/on_one_456_steel_hardtail_frame_2011
"On-One 456") mountain bike. It has
[Panaracer Crosstown](http://www.panaracer.com/urban.php#crosstown
"Panaracer Crosstown tyres") tyres on it, which reduce the rolling resistance
somewhat, but with 70 cm bars and 26 in wheels, it is not optimal for commuting.
And finally, I want to use it for what it was built for -- getting muddy from
riding off-road!

All these factors were used to justify spending money on a new bike. Having
been impressed by my On-One frame, I looked to its sister company -- Planet X.
Steel was the only real option for my budget, but I was also impressed with it
from my mountain bike. I therefore bought a black
[Kaffenback](http://planet-x-bikes.co.uk/i/q/FRPXKV2/planet_x_kaffenback_swap_out_frame
"Kaffenback swap-out frame") frame in February, and have been selecting and
ordering components for it ever since. With almost everything delivered, I
finally started building the bike.

##Wheels
I decided to build the wheels for this bike. It is actually the second set of wheels
I have built, but I have never actually *ridden* on a set of wheels I have
built, and I thought it was about time I did.

I chose
[Shimano 105](http://cycle.shimano-eu.com/publish/content/global_cycle/en/nl/index/components/road/105_5700.html
"Shimano 105") hubs,
[Mavic Open Sport](http://www.mavic.com/en/product/rims/road-triathlon/rims/Open-Sport
"Mavic Open Sport rims") rims and
[DT Swiss](http://www.dtswiss.com/Products/Components/Spokes/DT-competition.aspx
"DT Swiss Competition Spokes") double butted spokes for the wheels.

Building the wheels went quite smoothly. I used the book available from
[Wheelpro](http://www.wheelpro.co.uk/wheelbuilding/book.php "Wheelpro book"),
which provides comprehensive instructions on all aspects of the build, even
including instructions for building your own truing stand. By far the most time
was spent truing the wheels. I found that the key was to work slowly, and to
apply tension to the wheels gradually, checking at each stage that the wheel
dish, lateral true and radial true were all OK. By doing this, the spoke
tension tended to sort itself out and not need any major adjustment. I got a
bit carried away trying to finish the rear wheel, and ended up with quite a
significant warp. After a bit of frustrating time spent with the spoke key, I
eventually released the tension in all the spokes and started re-truing. This
time the build went much more smoothly.

I have no experience with road tyres, and frankly they look far too narrow to
be capable of supporting me! However, after some research I ordered a pair of
[Schwalbe Durano](http://www.schwalbe.co.uk/road-race/durano/ "Schwalbe Durano
tyres") tyres.

###Bottom bracket
The first job on the frame was to install the bottom bracket. An English thread
is needed for this frame. Installing it was quite
frustrating to do, as it is easy to cross-thread the cups as you screw them in.
Unfortunately, whilst the left hand side went smoothly, the right hand side did
end up being slightly cross-threaded. At this point I was in a position of
having greasy hands with little bits of swarf getting in the way. After
cleaning the threads as well as possible, I was finally able to get the thread
correctly engaged and tighten it all up.

</figure>

###Crankset
With the bottom bracket installed, the crankset is installed fairly easily. It
is a tight fit though, so it was a case of pushing the axle of the crank
firmly until it slid past each bottom bracket cup. After that, the left hand
crank is attached the axle splines and everything is torqued up. I chose a
Shimano Tiagra compact double crankset that will be initially paired with a
12-25 cassette.

###Front and rear derailleurs
Installing both derailleurs is straightforward. The front derailleur is
attached by a simple band clamp to the seat tube -- the key thing here is to
align it so that the outer plate of the cage is parallel with the biggest
chainring and also that the height of the derailleur above the chainring is
correct.

On this frame it is possible to swap the drop-outs to change from a
derailleur-geared bike to a single speed or hub-geared bike. The red pieces of
metal shown below are therefore removable. The rear derailleur is simply
attached to this removable drop-out.

###Brakes
The Kaffenback is marketed as a do-it-all frame -- with swappable drop-outs
that include disc brake mounts, builds of this frame could be anything from
lightweight singlespeed to laden touring bikes. My primary use for it is for
commuting, and had I bought a pure road bike frame, I would have simply
installed a set of road calliper brakes. Unfortunately, the frame does not
have the correct mounts for callipers, and I was left with choosing between
cantilever and linear-pull brakes.

After doing some research and looking at availability of different brakes, I
chose a set of cantilever brakes. Installing them to the bike was the easy step;
I then began the awkward process of setting them up.

Cable stops for the cantilever brakes are achieved by the use of hangers fitted
to the steerer tube for the front brake, and to the seat clamp for the rear
brake. The rear hanger gave me a bit of trouble. It hangs off the seat clamp
bolt and originally protruded too far into the seat tube, obstructing the seat
post. I fixed the problem by sanding off a small amount of the offending edge
on the hanger until it did not interfere with the seat post. Getting the length
of the outer cable housing correct was a bit of a guessing game, but I ended up
having the cable follow a shallow bend around the seat tube.

To be able to adjust the brakes, I needed to fit the handlebar and therefore
the stem as well. I also fitted the wheels at times.

The main problem with adjusting the brakes is that, for the pads alone, there
are five separate adjustments to be made, but on my brakes there are only two
bolts to tighten. This means that the pad has to be held carefully in place
whilst gingerly tightening the bolts up. If it isn't right, you have to start
again. According the various sources, cantilever brake setup is crucial to them
performing adequately, and since I have been used to the luxury of hydraulic
disc brakes on my bikes for the last four years, I wanted at least a hint of
braking performance.

After a rather frustrating time, I had set up all four brake arms as best I
could. I tried to ensure that each had an amount of toe-in to avoid squealing
braking.

</a>
<figcaption class="group">
Aligning the brake pads with the rim was a fiddly job, but it got done.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Adjusting up the pads was just the first step in getting my brakes set up. Next
to try my patience was getting the cables installed and adjusted. Basically I
needed to set up the straddle cable for each brake so that the leverage was
sufficiently high when the brakes were applied. On the front this was hindered
by the very wide brake arms; these limited the extent of adjustment possible
whilst still allowing the arms to be disconnected to install or remove the
wheel. The profile of the rear brake arms is lower, making the setup a bit
easier.

With straddle cables set, the brake cable running from the brake levers could
be adjusted. The main effect of adjusting the attachment of the brake cable to
the straddle cable anchor bolt was to alter the amount of slack in the brake
levers and clearance between the brake pads and the wheel rims. Once all of
this looked all right, I tightened everything up, and just hoped it would be able
to stop me!

##Chain installation and gear setup
The chain installation was a fairly straightforward process. After measuring
the required chain length, remeasuring it after realising I had had it on the
wrong chainring, I finally removed the correct number of links using a chain
tool. All that was required then was to route the chain correctly and join it
using a special pin.

With the chain installed, I set about adjusting the limit screws of the front
and rear derailleurs. Finally, with the limit screws set to keep the chain where
it belongs, I was able to begin setting the indexing of the gears. This was
surprisingly easy, and I soon had smooth shifts across the majority of the gear
range. I knew it would be likely that things would be different under load when
riding, so I left the gears as they were, tightened down the anchor bolts and
cut the excess cable.

##Bar tape
I bought the bars and shifters as a single unit, and they came with white bar
tape fitted. I considered leaving that on, but as the bike began to take shape
I knew that I needed to have a different colour of tape. In the end I went for
safe black, and bought some
[Arundel](http://www.arundelbike.com/cork.html?p=1.1.3.2 "Arundel Cork Bar tape")
cork bar tape.

Fitting the tape wasn't as difficult as I thought, but was a bit awkward around
the brake levers. I found a
[guide from Park Tool Co.](http://www.parktool.com/blog/repair-help/handlebar-tape-installation-drop-bar
"Handlebar tape installation guide")
to be useful. The end result is a little rough, but I am happy
enough with it for now.

purpose.

##Steerer tube installation
With the bike starting to take shape, it was time to carry out a particularly
irreversible act: cutting the steerer tube. Compared to everything else so far,
the idea of taking a hacksaw to a new component seemed quite severe. However,
it obviously needed to be carried out. I was quite uncertain about the stem
height at first, so I added a bit extra to my original calculations just in
case I couldn't ride comfortably.

To cut the steerer tube as accurately and as neatly as I could, I used a
cutting guide. This was clamped onto the steerer tube and basically constrains
the motion of the hacksaw blade. It did a good job, and after carefully filing
off the burred metal with a Dremel it was time to fit the star fangled nut.

</a>
<figcaption class="group">

job much easier.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Compared to cutting the steerer tube, I expected fitting the star fangled nut
to be a piece of cake, but it wasn't. The problem was simply not being able to
force the nut into the tube in a controlled manner. Eventually I had the nut in
the tube, but keeping it set at the right angle was not going well.

The correct tool for a particular job is often nice to have, but it is not
the end of the world if you don't have one. In the case of fitting the star
fangled nut, however, the right tool makes all the difference. After fitting
the tool to my wonky nut, only a couple of taps of a mallet was all that was
required to set the nut properly.

##Finishing off and the first ride
With all the major components installed and set up, plus some additional
initial adjustments such as saddle position and handlebar angle, it was time to
take the Kaffenback for its first ride.

As strange as it sounds, I was quite nervous at riding the bike. This was
mainly due to a previous incident on a bike's first ride, but there were also
some legitimate concerns:

 * This was my first road bike
 * This would be the first time riding wheels built by myself
 * I had ridden with powerful and reliable hydraulic disc brakes for the last 3
   years and I would be hoping that cantilevers would stop me
 * Compared to mountain bike tyres, the thin strips of rubber adorning my
   wheels did not look like they would offer any sort of grip
 * Narrow drop bars and a steep head angle were bound to feel different to wide
   riser bars with a slacker head angle

On the morning of 13 May I wheeled my bike outside for the first time.
Gingerly, I started riding it, checking I could use the STI shifters, checking
that the brakes worked and that the wheels weren't falling to pieces. Given my
apprehension about the ride, it turned out to be quite an anticlimax. Everything
seemed to work and there were no major issues. Yet I didn't feel immediately
comfortable on the bike, and there were a couple of niggling issues.

The most noticeable problem was interference between my left heel and the
chainstay. My right heel interfered too but it was less severe. After riding
for a while I had moved my heel out a bit, but that then put pressure on my
foot and knee. The other immediate issue I had was with the bars. I felt every
single bump in the road and it was all transmitted through the base of my
thumb. At the time I couldn't imagine ever wanting to ride a long distance on
the bike. The drop bars too were a novelty. Riding on the hoods felt all right,
but as soon as I tried out the drops it just felt like I was in a very
uncomfortable position.

I rode about 14 km on the first ride. Except for the minor problems described,
nothing terrible happened. Although I was going to have to get used to the bike
and tweak a few things, there were hints of a good bike showing through. It was
noticeably lighter than my mountain bike and it felt a bit quicker to
accelerate. Climbing with it felt pretty good too, although the gearing felt so
high compared to the gears I was used to on my mountain bike.

Overall, although slightly underwhelmed by the first ride, I was not
disappointed with it. I knew I needed to get used to it before being completely
happy with it, so decided to put it straight to work as my commuting bike.
